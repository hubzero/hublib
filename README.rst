hublib
======

hublib is a Python library for the `HUBzero`_ science gateway platform.  It is designed
to be used with  `Jupyter`_ notebooks on the hubs, although the ui module should work in any notebooks.
Hubs running the Jupyter service
include HUBzero and `nanoHUB`_.  

* hublib.ui - Makes it easy to create a simple GUI for scientific code in a Jupyter notebook.  Built
  on top of `ipywidgets`_ and `pint`_.
* hublib.use - Loads hub environment modules.
